# Hanger-Door


This project is for a custom door opener. 
The reasoning behind it was to avoid having to knock on the hangar door every time I wanted to get in. 
So, I made a system that opens it up for me. 

Parts: 
Raspberry Pi 
Stepper motor 
L298N Motor Driver Controller Board Module 
Battery pack for cellphones to provide power to the boards
